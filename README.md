# FireHawk CRM Tributes - SEOPress & SEOPress Pro Integration
 
If you use SEOPress on your WordPress funeral website, this replaces the current bundled Yoast SEO integration of the FireHawkCRM Tributes plugin with added support for SEOPress and SEOPress Pro.

Currently FireHawk CRM Tributes WordPress plugin relies on using the YoastSEO Plugin to add the required title and meta tags to the individual tribute & funeral pages.
This add-on adds compatibility for [SEOPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/) instead if you use the free [SEOPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/) or [SEOPress Pro](https://www.seopress.org/) instead instead of YoastSEO.

Tribute meta page tags are then controlled by SEOPress

It also adds a setting for a default social share image which can be set for tributes sit-ewide.

FireHawk CRM and their WordPress tributes plugin are from [FireHawk Funerals](https://firehawkfunerals.com)
