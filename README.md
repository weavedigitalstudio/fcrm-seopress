# FireHawk CRM Tributes - SEOPress & SEOPress Pro Integration

Currently FireHawk CRM Tributes WordPress plugin relies on using the YoastSEO Plagin to add the required title and meta tags to the individual tribute & funeral pages.
This adds compatibility for [SEOPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/) instead if you use the free [SEOPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/) or [SEOPress Pro](https://www.seopress.org/) instead instead of YoastSEO.

From v1.1 it also adds a setting page for a custom field for a default social share image which can be set sitewide.

FireHawk CRM and their WordPress tributes plugin are from [FireHawk Funerals](https://firehawkfunerals.com)
